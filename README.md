# ABOUT
Here you'll find a series of products (tangible interfaces) developed using Arduino. Some of these are personal projects, while others are products on which I was hired as a developer.

# PERSONAL MIDI PROJECTS
> Trigger MIDI (also known as Octo MIDI Trigger)
Octo MIDI Drum is a MIDI trigger drum developed using open-source Arduino. It's a model that belongs to the Tacuara MIDI line, a personal entrepreneurial venture. 
Some industrial designer colleagues became enthusiastic when they saw the work I had been doing. So, for the final stage of the project, they decided to get involved with the design and improve it.

> Nawal 6 (a MIDI Footswitch)
Nawal-6 was a model integral to a personal venture named Tacuara MIDI, focused on the development and commercialization of MIDI-based devices utilizing Arduino technology. 
Nawal-6 specifically was a MIDI footswitch crafted for guitarists aiming to interface with VSTs and effect pedals equipped with MIDI controls.


# INDUSTRIAL DESIGN PROJECTS
> Envasadora
Was a project I developed it for a group of Industrial Designers from FADU/UBA.
The project revolved around the design of a soft food dispensing machine, catering to products such as mayonnaise, jams, and similar items. 
My responsibility encompassed the development of the entire electromechanical system, including circuitry and the implementation of a logical control system using Arduino.

> Improvi
Improvi is a sound sequencer developed on the Arduino platform, allowing students to experiment and engage with the world of sound in a playful, immediate, and collaborative manner. 
Together with a group of Industrial Design students (FADU-UBA) comprised of Luca Cantarelli, Tomas Ottolenghi, and Julieta Vergottini, we developed Improvi, an interactive device focused on musical and sound education.

> Sigue Girando
Based on 'Musical chairs', also known as Trip to Jerusalem, is a game of elimination involving players, chairs, and music. It is a staple of many parties worldwide. 
This version was thought for greens and city parks. The project was designed for Industrial Designers and I developed it on arduino platform.
